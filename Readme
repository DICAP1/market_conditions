Here’s a concise yet comprehensive description you can add to your README file to explain what your Python script does:

---

## 📊 Forex Market Analysis & Strategy Recommendation Tool

This Python script connects to the **OANDA API** to perform **real-time and historical market analysis** on a wide range of forex instruments. It utilizes **technical indicators**, **machine learning**, and **pattern recognition** to analyze price data and recommend trading strategies.

### 🔧 Features:

* **Real-Time Price Fetching**
  Connects to OANDA to retrieve up-to-the-minute bid/ask prices for major and minor currency pairs.

* **Historical Data Analysis**
  Gathers 500 past 30-minute candles per instrument and calculates various **technical indicators** using TA-Lib, including:

  * RSI, ADX
  * MACD and Signal line
  * EMA (20, 50, 200)
  * ATR (Average True Range)
  * Pinbar (Hammer) pattern detection

* **Machine Learning Forecasting**
  Applies a **linear regression model** to forecast the next closing price for trend prediction.

* **Signal Detection**
  Identifies several market signals:

  * Momentum direction
  * Trend strength (via ADX)
  * MACD bullish/bearish crossovers
  * Volatility clustering and breakout detection
  * Anomalies (e.g., widened spreads, high ATR)
  * Candle pattern recognition (Pinbar)

* **Strategy Recommendation Engine**
  Based on combined signal weightings, the system suggests one of the following:

  * 📈 Buy Strategy
  * 📉 Sell Strategy
  * ⏸️ Neutral Strategy
  * ⚠️ Caution Strategy
  * ⚡ Scalping Strategy (based on custom logic)

* **Confidence Scoring**
  Calculates a strategy confidence percentage by comparing signal alignment with predicted market direction.

* **Logging**
  Logs all key decisions and errors to `market_analysis.log` for monitoring and troubleshooting.

* **Automation**
  Runs in an infinite loop with 60-second intervals to continuously update strategy insights.




***market condition analyser2***

This Python script connects to the OANDA API and performs real-time and historical analysis on a wide range of Forex instruments. It uses a range of technical indicators and a machine learning-based model (Linear Regression) to:

🔄 Fetch live and historical pricing data

🧠 Compute indicators like RSI, MACD, ADX, EMA, ATR, and detect patterns (e.g. pinbar, breakout)

🤖 Automatically select the best combination of indicators using grid search for linear regression

📊 Predict future price movements and evaluate model performance (R², MAE, RMSE)

📌 Detect key market signals (trend, momentum, spread, volatility, anomalies)

📢 Recommend trading strategies: Buy, Sell, Neutral, etc.

✅ Log and print insights with strategy confidence scoring
